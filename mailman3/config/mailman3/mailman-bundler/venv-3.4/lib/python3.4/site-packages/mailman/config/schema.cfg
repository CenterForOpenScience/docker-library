#
# X-Spam: (yes|maybe)
#
# The header value and regular expression are always matched

header_checks:

# then Mailman will attempt to log into the MTA when making a new connection.

# Ceiling on the number of recipients that can be specified in a single SMTP
# transaction.  Set to 0 to submit the entire recipient list in one

max_recipients: 500

# Ceiling on the number of SMTP sessions to perform on a single socket
# connection.  Some MTAs have limits.  Set this to 0 to do as many as we like
# (i.e. your MTA has no limits).  Set this to some number great than 0 and
# Mailman will close the SMTP connection and re-open it after this number of
# consecutive sessions.
max_sessions_per_connection: 0

# Maximum number of simultaneous subthreads that will be used for SMTP
# delivery.  After the recipients list is chunked according to max_recipients,
# each chunk is handed off to the SMTP server by a separate such thread.  If
# your Python interpreter was not built for threads, this feature is disabled.
# You can explicitly disable it in all cases by setting max_delivery_threads
# to 0.
max_delivery_threads: 0

# How long should messages which have delivery failures continue to be
# retried?  After this period of time, a message that has failed recipients
# will be dequeued and those recipients will never receive the message.
delivery_retry_period: 5d

# These variables control the format and frequency of VERP-like delivery for
# better bounce detection.  VERP is Variable Envelope Return Path, defined
# here:
#
# http://cr.yp.to/proto/verp.txt
#
# This involves encoding the address of the recipient as Mailman knows it into
# the envelope sender address (i.e. RFC 5321 MAIL FROM).  Thus, no matter what
# kind of forwarding the recipient has in place, should it eventually bounce,
# we will receive an unambiguous notice of the bouncing address.
#
# However, we're technically only "VERP-like" because we're doing the envelope
# sender encoding in Mailman, not in the MTA.  We do require cooperation from
# the MTA, so you must be sure your MTA can be configured for extended address
# semantics.
#
# The first variable describes how to encode VERP envelopes.  It must contain
# these three string interpolations, which get filled in by Mailman:
#
# $bounces -- the list's -bounces robot address will be set here
# $local   -- the recipient address's local mailbox part will be set here
# $domain  -- the recipient address's domain name will be set here
#
# This example uses the default below.
#
# FQDN list address is: mylist@dom.ain
# Recipient is:         aperson@a.nother.dom
#
# The envelope sender will be mylist-bounces+aperson=a.nother.dom@dom.ain
#
# Note that your MTA /must/ be configured to deliver such an addressed message
# to mylist-bounces!
verp_delimiter: +
verp_format: ${bounces}+${local}=${domain}

# For nicer confirmation emails, use a VERP-like format which encodes the
# confirmation cookie in the reply address.  This lets us put a more user
# friendly Subject: on the message, but requires cooperation from the MTA.
# Format is like verp_format, but with the following substitutions:
#
# $address  -- the list-confirm address
# $cookie   -- the confirmation cookie
verp_confirm_format: $address+$cookie

# This regular expression unambiguously decodes VERP addresses, which will be
# placed in the To: (or other, depending on the MTA) header of the bounce
# message by the bouncing MTA.  Getting this right is critical -- and tricky.
# Learn your Python regular expressions.  It must define exactly three named
# groups, `bounces`, `local` and `domain`, with the same definition as above.
# It will be compiled case-insensitively.
verp_regexp: ^(?P<bounces>[^+]+?)\+(?P<local>[^=]+)=(?P<domain>[^@]+)@.*$

# This is analogous to verp_regexp, but for splitting apart the
# verp_confirm_format.  MUAs have been observed that mung
#
# From: local_part@host
#
# into
#
# To: "local_part" <local_part@host>
#
# when replying, so we skip everything up to '<' if any.
verp_confirm_regexp: ^(.*<)?(?P<addr>[^+]+?)\+(?P<cookie>[^@]+)@.*$

# Set this to 'yes' to enable VERP-like (more user friendly) confirmations.
verp_confirmations: no

# Another good opportunity is when regular delivery is personalized.  Here
# again, we're already incurring the performance hit for addressing each
# individual recipient.  Set this to 'yes' to enable VERPs on all personalized
# regular deliveries (personalized digests aren't supported yet).
verp_personalized_deliveries: no

# And finally, we can VERP normal, non-personalized deliveries.  However,
# because it can be a significant performance hit, we allow you to decide how
# often to VERP regular deliveries.  This is the interval, in number of
# messages, to do a VERP recipient address.  The same variable controls both
# regular and digest deliveries.  Set to 0 to disable occasional VERPs, set to
# 1 to VERP every delivery, or to some number > 1 for only occasional VERPs.
verp_delivery_interval: 0

# VERP format and regexp for probe messages.
verp_probe_format: $bounces+$token@$domain
verp_probe_regexp: ^(?P<bounces>[^+]+?)\+(?P<token>[^@]+)@.*$
# Set this 'yes' to activate VERP probe for disabling by bounce.
verp_probes: no

# This is the maximum number of automatic responses sent to an address because
# of -request messages or posting hold messages.  This limit prevents response
# loops between Mailman and misconfigured remote email robots.  Mailman
# already inhibits automatic replies to any message labeled with a header
# "Precendence: bulk|list|junk".  This is a fallback safety valve so it should
# be set fairly high.  Set to 0 for no limit (probably useful only for
# debugging).
max_autoresponses_per_day: 10

# Some list posts and mail to the -owner address may contain DomainKey or
# DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) signature headers <http://www.dkim.org/>.
# Various list transformations to the message such as adding a list header or
# footer or scrubbing attachments or even reply-to munging can break these
# signatures.  It is generally felt that these signatures have value, even if
# broken and even if the outgoing message is resigned.  However, some sites
# may wish to remove these headers by setting this to 'yes'.
remove_dkim_headers: no

# Where can we find the mail server specific configuration file?  The path can

# This controls how headers must be cleansed in order to be accepted by your

# headers, or duplicate headers.  The NNTP server may reject the message for
# other reasons, but there's little that can be programmatically done about
# that.

# These headers (case ignored) are removed from the original message.  This is
